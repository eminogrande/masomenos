# Membership Program with NFT and Exponential Bonding Curve

## Overview

Welcome to our Membership Program, a community-driven ecosystem built on the Solana blockchain. This program allows users to become members by minting a unique **Membership NFT**. Once you own the Membership NFT, you'll gain access to mint our **native currency**, which can be used for community-exclusive benefits and future project perks.

The minting price for both the Membership NFT and our currency follows an **exponential bonding curve**, meaning the price increases as more tokens are minted. This ensures that early adopters are rewarded while helping sustain the growth of the ecosystem.

We are building this program using the **Metaplex** framework on Solana to ensure security, scalability, and ease of use.

## Key Features

- **Membership NFT**: Mint an NFT to become a verified member of the community.
- **Native Currency**: Mint our currency token once you own the Membership NFT. Use it for exclusive community benefits and future project participation.
- **Exponential Bonding Curve**: Both the NFT and currency prices increase as more are minted, encouraging early participation and supporting long-term growth.
- **Built on Solana**: Fast, scalable, and secure blockchain infrastructure.
- **Metaplex Framework**: Leveraging Metaplex for NFT minting, management, and metadata storage.

## How It Works

### 1. Mint the Membership NFT

To join the community, you first need to mint a **Membership NFT**. This NFT represents your membership status and unlocks access to mint the native currency. The minting price follows an **exponential bonding curve** that increases as more NFTs are minted.

- The minting price will start at a lower rate but will increase exponentially as more NFTs are minted.
- Each NFT is unique and tied to your identity within the community.
  
**Minting Process:**
- Navigate to the minting page (link provided below).
- Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Sollet, etc.).
- Mint your Membership NFT by paying the current minting price in SOL.
  
### 2. Mint the Native Currency

Once you have minted the Membership NFT, you can then proceed to mint our **native currency**. The price of the currency also follows an exponential bonding curve, so the earlier you mint, the lower the price.

- The currency will be used for community-driven activities, governance, and exclusive events.
- Currency mints are tied to your membership status. Without a Membership NFT, you won't be able to mint the currency.

**Minting Process:**
- After acquiring the Membership NFT, go to the currency minting page.
- The minting price will be based on the current bonding curve, so the earlier you mint, the cheaper it is.
- Mint the currency to your connected wallet.
